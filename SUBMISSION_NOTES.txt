My answer comprises the Ruby script collate.rb and the output file output.json.
The script is compatible with Ruby 2.0.0 and ought to work just as well with
later versions. It can be run from within the san/ directory as follows:

  ruby collate.rb

I decided not to de-duplicate identical results since I was not sure if these
were actually duplicates, or simply replications of the same test on the same
sample.
